# Eastern Europe research group

>We have the following agenda:

>1) Since we need an overview of who does what at the moment, please prepare a very concise 5 minutes about:
> - your on-going research and/or future plan(s)
> - where are you heading at and what is your roadmap to this?

>2) We have to find some common platform (2-3 lines of research directions) so please come with a flexible and innovative mind. We all should have an idea of our main (2-3) underlying concepts for further discussion. This is for mapping out our comparative potential within the group, first.

>3) Following the above mentioned we should try to put ourselves into context with the CoE and also with current global scientific trends. What is out there and what could be ground-breaking in that regard?

>4) Please, send me the top 2-3 international journals in your field of study beforehand and I will gather a list for the meeting.

>5) I hope Jouni agrees to prepare a suggestion about how we could contribute to the IKEBB/Ukraine programme. 

# Current

Currently my time is shared between three domains. 

1. my own/collaborative projects within my field of science
2. software/coding projects
    - [my project](http://muuankarski.github.io/phdthesis/)
3.  CoE etc.
    - research, data & infrastructure

# Future

## With Olli Kangas (Academy professor applicattion)

>EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF AND THE DEVIL TAKE THE HINDMOST! ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION IN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING SOCIETIES

>Argument in this project is that market forces alone will not create a solution to the problems of globalization. As indicated by the 16th century English proverb quoted in our title, in a society where everyone is only for him/herself there are too many for the devil. Undeniably markets are an efficient institution for allocating economic resources. However, efficiency does not guarantee social justice. Justice requires government to redistribute income from richest to the poorest and to protect the vulnerable. There is a strong case for social policy. The characteristics of the state action matter not only for distributional outcomes, but also for the legitimacy of the regime, social cohesion and in the end also for economic growth. In a fair society there is nobody for the devil, neither in the West nor in the Rest.

## research software carpentry & academic working practises in digital era

- open science: data, methods & publishing
- (digital) academic working practises

### Relevant for the EE group

- rOpenGov: Eastern Europe developers/data/projects
- Euro-election app (eurovaalikone) - what to ask?

## Coe

As this is a "counter force" to CoE I would like to see Coe to become productive first..
